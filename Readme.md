## Own Hashmap / Dictionary

I just wanted to implement a hashmap just learn about implementing data structures and so on by myself.
Class covers several methods like get Key or get Values,  add elements or return the overall size of the dictionary, meaning the total number of keys.
The dictionary itself is implemented linked-list like containing pointers to the next item.

I am planning to implement a function which allows one to change the value of a key.
